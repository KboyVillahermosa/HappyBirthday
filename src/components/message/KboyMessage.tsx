            I know weâ€™re miles apart today, but my heart is with you,
            celebrating every beautiful moment of your special day. Youâ€™re the
            most amazing person Iâ€™ve ever known, and I wish I could give you the
            worldâ€”everything you deserve and more.

            I feel so sorry that I canâ€™t shower you with grand gifts or
            surprises right now, but I hope you can see my heart in this website
            I made for you. Itâ€™s my way of showing how much you mean to me, even
            if Iâ€™m not physically there to hold your hand and make you feel as
            special as you truly are.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-5 text-gray-900">
            You inspire me every day to work harder and dream bigger. One day,
            Iâ€™ll be able to give you the life you deserve. Until then, please
            know that my love for you is infinite and my heart is always yours,
            no matter the distance.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5 text-gray-900">
          I hope this day brings you nothing but joy and love, just like the happiness youâ€™ve brought into my life. I love you so much! Happy Birthday again, my gorgeous girl! ðŸ’–
